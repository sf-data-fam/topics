Before diving into different types of data projects, I'll go over the factors that make for an excellent project. When choosing projects, keep this three factors in mind:

## 1. Personal Interest
Obvious, but find a project that aligns with your personal passions such as sports, tv shows, books, politics, entertainment, finance etc.

## 2. Relevant Skillset 
After ensuring the project is something you're personally interested in, make sure the project aligns with a skillset that's relevant to the market. For example, Support Vector Machines are being used less and less in industry. If SVM is the best algorithm to solve your problem, definitely use it. But be cognizant that the ML industry is shifting away from SVM and more towards Deep Learning/Neural Networks.

Always keep a pulse on what skillsets are valuable on the market. This way, you can ensure that your time is not just spent cultivating personal interests but also having it be relevant for your career.

## 3. Value-Add
Once you've got the first two down, the ideal scenario would be to use this project to create real value for someone else. This is great for three reasons:

One, if you had a ton of value, a business can actually pay you for your work. Everybody loves more mulah.

Two, even if you don't get paid for it, companies love seeing projects that actually created value for some organization. It's a much better sell when you're looking for a new job.

Three, helping others = fulfillment.
